# MG-optimal-sizing-and-operation
A deterministic MILP for the optimal unit sizing and operation of a combined-heat-and-power microgrid, based on the work of [Zachar et al. (2015)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compchemeng.2015.03.012). This repo was part of my Bachelor's Thesis at [ChemEngUP](https://www.chemeng.upatras.gr/).
